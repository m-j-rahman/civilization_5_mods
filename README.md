# Civilization V Mods

A collection of my mods for the game Sid Meier's Civilization V.

## Usage

Clone the collection

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/m-j-rahman/civilization_5_mods.git
```

Copy or move the folder for the mod you want to use to the MODS folder.

Windows: 

* Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5\MODS

Mac:

* Documents/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization V/MODS

Linux:

* ~/.local/share/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS

For example, to use the mod "Nearby Observatories" on a Linux machine, the path should end up as:  
* ~/.local/share/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS/nearby_observatories  
The mod should then be available to select from the in-game Mods screen.  
Restart the game if it is already running.  

## Collection

### Civ Buffs - Carthage:
Carthage is one of the weakest civs. All of its bonuses look better than they actually are and quickly become redundant. This mod buffs Carthage while keeping the current style of the civ.
* Trait now also provides +50% total trade routes.
* African Forest Elephant replaced by Barca, a unique Great General. It has higher Movement, debuffs nearby enemy units, and also acts as a Great Admiral.
* Quinquereme changed to Naval Ranged unit, like the Byzantine Dromon. It has 10 Combat Strength, 11 Ranged Strength, 2 Range, Quick Study promotion, and upgrades into Galleass.

### Civ Buffs - Japan:
Japan is one of the weakest civs. All of its bonuses look better than they actually are and quickly become redundant. This mod buffs Japan while keeping the current style of the civ.
* Trait now also provides a +10% Combat Bonus. +2 Culture from Fishing Boats instead of +1.
* Zero replaced by Dojo, a Barracks replacement that gives +2 Culture and +2 Science.
* Samurai available at Metal Casting instead of Steel, and upgrades into Musketman instead of Rifleman.

### Inspired Generals:
The Great Generals I and II promotions have vague descriptions, and are often weak. Units with the Great Generals I promotion now have Great Generals II instead, which is renamed Inspired Generals and has a more helpful in-game description.

### Melee Mounted Paths:
Changes some unit upgrade paths and buffs some of those units.
* Warrior and its unique replacements upgrade into Spearman instead of Swordsman. They also become obsolete at Civil Service instead of Metal Casting.
* Pikeman and Landsknecht upgrade into Musketman instead of Lancer. Impi is unchanged and still upgrades into Rifleman.
* Knight and its unique replacements upgrade into Lancer instead of Cavalry.
* Lancer and its unique replacements upgrade into Cavalry instead of Anti-Tank Gun. They also have their Combat Strength increased from 25 to 28.

### Nearby Observatories:
Observatories are the only reason to settle cities adjacent to mountains. This mod makes them available in cities within 2 tiles of a mountain in your borders instead, like the Machu Pichu and Neuschwanstein wonders.
