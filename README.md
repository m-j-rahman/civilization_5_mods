# Civilization V Mods

A collection of my mods for the game Sid Meier's Civilization V.

## Usage

Clone the collection

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/m-j-rahman/civilization_5_mods.git
```

Copy the folder for the mod you want to use to the MODS folder.

Windows: 

* Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5\MODS

Mac:

* Documents/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization V/MODS

Linux:

* ~/.local/share/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS

The mod should then be available to select from the in-game Mods screen. Restart the game if it is already running.

## Collection

#### Inspired Generals:
The Great Generals I and II promotions have vague descriptions, and are often weak. Units with the Great Generals I promotion now have Great Generals II instead, which is renamed Inspired Generals and has a more helpful in-game description.

#### Melee Mounted Paths:
Changes some unit upgrade paths and buffs some of those units.
* Warrior and its unique replacements upgrade into Spearman instead of Swordsman. They also become obsolete at Civil Service instead of Metal Casting.
* Pikeman and Landsknecht upgrade into Musketman instead of Lancer. Impi is unchanged and still upgrades into Rifleman.
* Knight and its unique replacements upgrade into Lancer instead of Cavalry.
* Lancer and its unique replacements upgrade into Cavalry instead of Anti-Tank Gun. They also have their Combat Strength increased from 25 to 28.

#### Nearby Observatories:
Observatories are the only reason to settle cities adjacent to mountains. This mod makes them available in cities within 2 tiles of a mountain in your borders instead, like the Machu Pichu and Neuschwanstein wonders.
