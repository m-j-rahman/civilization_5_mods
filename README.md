A collection of my mods for the game Sid Meier's Civilization V.

## Usage

Clone the collection

Restart the game if it is already running.  

## Collection

### Civ Buffs - Assyria:
Assyria is usually a weak civ on higher difficulties, due to being quickly outpaced before they can take advantage of their bonuses. This mod buffs Assyria to make it an effective domination civ.
* Royal Library now gives +15 XP without needing to fill the Great Work slot (instead of +10 XP after filling the Great Work slot).
* Siege Tower now has 14 Combat Strength (up from 12) and can attack other units. It upgrades into Musketman (instead of Trebuchet).

### Civ Buffs - Carthage:
Carthage is one of the weakest civs. All of its bonuses look better than they actually are and quickly become redundant. This mod buffs Carthage to make it an effective domination civ.
* African Forest Elephant replaced by Barca, a unique Great General. It has higher Movement, debuffs nearby enemy units, and also acts as a Great Admiral.
* Quinquereme changed to a Naval Ranged unit. It has 10 Combat Strength, 11 Ranged Strength, 2 Range, Quick Study promotion, and upgrades into Galleass (instead of Caravel).

### Civ Buffs - Iroquois:
The Iroquois are the weakest normal civ (i.e. besides Venice). Their unique ability doesn't work as intended, their unique building is worse than the normal version, and their unique unit is insignificant. This mod buffs the Iroquois to fix all of that.
* Trait completely replaced. It now provides the Woodsman promotion to all military land units, as well as +1 Food from Camps and unimproved Forests.
* Longhouse now also gives the same Production bonus as the normal Workshop (+10%) and costs 90 Production to build (down from 100, vs 120 for Workshop).
* Mohawk Warrior now replaces Longswordsman (instead of Swordsman). It is available at Metal Casting (instead of Steel).

### Civ Buffs - Japan:
Japan is one of the weakest civs. All of its bonuses look better than they actually are and are very situational. This mod buffs Japan to make it an effective domination civ.
* Trait now also provides a +10% Combat Bonus. +1 Culture from Atolls (instead of +2).
* Zero replaced by Dojo, a unique Barracks. It gives +3 Culture.
* Samurai now available at Metal Casting (instead of Steel). It upgrades into Musketman (instead of Rifleman). It has the Cover I promotion (instead of Shock I).

### Inspired Generals:
The Great Generals I and II promotions are usually weak and have unclear descriptions. This mod renames Great Generals II to Inspired Generals and gives it a more helpful description. Units with the Great Generals I promotion now have Inspired Generals instead.

### Unit Path Rework:
This mod changes the stats and upgrade paths of melee and mounted units for better balance and variety.
* Warrior and its unique replacements now upgrade into Spearman (instead of Swordsman). They also become obsolete at Civil Service (instead of Metal Casting). This makes them independant of Iron availability.
* Swordsman and its unique replacements now have 16 Combat Strength (up from 14), except the Roman Legion which now has 18 Combat Strength (up from 17). This makes them competitive with the Pikeman.
* Pike and Shot introduced as a standard unit. It is based on the Spanish Tercio, except with 21 Combat Strength and 150 Production Cost.
* Spanish Tercio now replaces Pike and Shot (instead of Musketman). It keeps its 26 Combat Strength and has 150 Production Cost (down from 160).
* Pikeman and Landsknecht now upgrade into Pike and Shot (instead of Lancer). Impi still upgrades into Rifleman. This keeps them in the same role rather than messing up the upgrade lines.
* Knight and its unique replacements now upgrade into Lancer (instead of Cavalry).
* Lancer and its unique replacements now upgrade into Cavalry (instead of Anti-Tank Gun). They also all have 28 Combat Strength (up from 25), but no longer gain the Formation I promotion.

### Nearby Observatories:
Observatories are the only reason to settle cities adjacent to mountains. This mod makes them available in cities within 2 tiles of a mountain that is inside your territory, like the Machu Pichu and Neuschwanstein wonders.
