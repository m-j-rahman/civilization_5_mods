# Civilization V Mods

A collection of my mods for the game Sid Meier's Civilization V.

## Usage

Clone the collection

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/m-j-rahman/civilization_5_mods.git
```

Copy the folder for the mod you want to use to the MODS folder.

Windows: 

* Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5\MODS

Mac:

* Documents/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization V/MODS

Linux:

* ~/.local/share/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS

The mod should then be available to select from the in-game Mods screen. Restart the game if it is already running.

## Collection

#### Nearby Observatories:
Observatories are the only reason to settle cities adjacent to mountains. This mod makes them available in cities within 2 tiles of a mountain in your borders instead, like the Machu Pichu and Neuschwanstein wonders.
