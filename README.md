# Civilization V Mods

A collection of my mods for the game Sid Meier's Civilization V.

## Usage

Clone the collection

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/m-j-rahman/civilization_5_mods.git
```

Copy or move the folder for the mod you want to use to the MODS folder.

Windows: 

* Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5\MODS

Mac:

* Documents/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization V/MODS

Linux:

* ~/.local/share/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS

For example, to use the mod "Nearby Observatories" on a Linux machine, the path should end up as:  
* ~/.local/share/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS/nearby_observatories

The mod should then be available to select from the in-game Mods screen.  
Restart the game if it is already running.  

## Collection

### Versioning:
* v1xx = Work in progress, more gameplay testing required
* v2xx = Mechanically complete, would be better with new icons/models, may change if bugs or balance issues are discovered
* v3xx = Complete, may change if bugs or balance issues are discovered

### Civ Buffs - Assyria (v301):
Assyria is usually a weak civ on higher difficulties, due to being quickly outpaced before they can take advantage of their bonuses. This mod makes Assyria a more effective domination civ.
* Royal Library buffed. It now gives +15 XP without needing to fill the Great Work slot (instead of +10 XP after filling the Great Work slot).
* Siege Tower buffed. It now has 14 Combat Strength (up from 12) and can attack other units. It upgrades into Musketman (instead of Trebuchet).

### Civ Buffs - Carthage (v301):
Carthage is one of the weakest civs. All of its bonuses look better than they actually are and quickly become redundant. This mod makes Carthage stronger and more fun to play.
* African Forest Elephant replaced by Barca, a unique Great General. As well as strengthening nearby friendly units, it weakens nearby enemy units. It has higher Movement on land and while embarked.
* Quinquereme buffed. It now has the Mobility and Sentry promotions. It can also build Fishing Boats without being consumed.

### Civ Buffs - Iroquois (v201):
The Iroquois are the weakest normal civ (i.e. besides Venice). Their ability doesn't work as intended, and both of their uniques are insignificant if not detrimental. This mod buffs the Iroquois to make them stronger and more fun to play.
* Trait reworked. Military land units gain the Woodsman promotion, granting them double movement through Forest and Jungle tiles. +1 Production and +1 Gold from Camps.
* Longhouse reworked. It is now a Unique Improvement (instead of a Workshop replacement). It is unlocked by Construction. It can be built on Forest and Jungle tiles (without removing them). It gives +2 Production. It also gives +2 Gold after researching Guilds.
* Mohawk Warrior reworked. It now replaces Scout (instead of Swordsman). It costs 45 Production (vs 25). It has 8 Combat Strength (vs 5). It upgrades into Composite Bowman and can do so even without Ancient Ruins.
To do - Longhouse currently uses the same icon and model as the Brazilwood Camp. A new one would be nicer, but it works fine without.

### Civ Buffs - Japan (v201):
Japan is one of the weakest civs. All of its bonuses look better than they actually are and are very situational. This mod makes Japan a more effective domination civ.
* Trait buffed. It now also provides a +10% Combat Bonus. However, it provides only +1 Culture from Atolls (instead of +2).
* Zero replaced by Dojo, a unique Barracks. It gives +3 Culture.
* Samurai buffed. It is now unlocked by Metal Casting (instead of Steel). It upgrades into Musketman (instead of Rifleman). It has the Cover I promotion (instead of Shock I).
To do - Dojo currently uses the same icon as the Barracks. A new one would be nicer, but it works fine without.

### Inspired Generals (v301):
The Great Generals I and II promotions are usually weak and have unclear descriptions. This mod renames Great Generals II to Inspired Generals and gives it a more helpful description. Units with the Great Generals I promotion now have Inspired Generals instead.

### Nearby Observatories (v301):
Observatories are the only reason to settle cities adjacent to mountains. This mod makes them available in cities within 2 tiles of a mountain that is inside your territory, like the Machu Pichu and Neuschwanstein wonders.

### Unit Path Rework (v106):
This mod changes the stats and upgrade paths of melee and mounted units for better balance and variety.
* Pike and Shot introduced as a standard unit. It is based on the Spanish Tercio, except with 21 Combat Strength and 150 Production Cost.
* Spanish Tercio now replaces Pike and Shot (instead of Musketman). It keeps its 26 Combat Strength and has 150 Production Cost (down from 160).
* Pikeman and Landsknecht now upgrade into Pike and Shot (instead of Lancer). Impi still upgrades into Rifleman. This keeps them in the same role rather than messing up the upgrade lines.
* Knight and its unique replacements now upgrade into Lancer (instead of Cavalry).
* Lancer and its unique replacements now upgrade into Cavalry (instead of Anti-Tank Gun). They also all have 28 Combat Strength (up from 25), but no longer gain the Formation I promotion.
