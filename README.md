A collection of my mods for the game Sid Meier's Civilization V.

## Usage

Clone the collection

```

Copy or move the folder for the mod you want to use to the MODS folder.

## Collection

### Building Buffs:
This mod buffs buildings that are either underpowered or lacking updates to fit with new resources from expansions.
* Granary now also provides +1 Food from Bison.
* Mint now also provides +2 Gold from Copper and can be built with improved Copper nearby.
* Caravansary now also provides +1 Gold and +1 Happiness.
* Stone Works can now be built in Cities on Plains as well.
* Windmill can now be built in Cities on Hills as well. Gives +5% Production to everything instead of +10% to only buildings. No longer has an Engineer slot, but gives +2 Food. Coffee House also changed to match.

### Civ Buffs - Assyria:
Assyria is usually a weak civ on higher difficulties, due to being quickly outpaced before they can take advantage of their bonuses. This mod makes Assyria a more effective domination civ.
* Royal Library buffed. It now gives +15 XP without needing to fill the Great Work slot (instead of +10 XP after filling the Great Work slot).
* Siege Tower buffed. It now has 14 Combat Strength (up from 12) and upgrades into Musketman (instead of Trebuchet).

### Civ Buffs - Carthage:
Carthage is one of the weakest civs. All of its bonuses look better than they actually are and quickly become redundant. This mod makes Carthage stronger and more fun to play.
* African Forest Elephant replaced by Barca, a unique Great General. As well as strengthening nearby friendly units, it weakens nearby enemy units. It has higher movement on land and while embarked.
* Quinquereme buffed. It now has 12 Combat Strength (down from 13), but has the Mobility promotion. It can also build Fishing Boats without being consumed, like the Japanese Samurai.

### Civ Buffs - Iroquois:
The Iroquois are the weakest normal civ (i.e. besides Venice). Their ability doesn't work as intended, and both of their uniques are insignificant if not detrimental. This mod makes the Iroquois stronger and more fun to play.
* Trait reworked. Military land units gain the Woodsman promotion, granting them double movement through Forest and Jungle tiles. +1 Production and +1 Gold from Camps.
* Longhouse reworked. It is now a Unique Improvement (instead of a Workshop replacement). It is unlocked by Construction. It can be built on Forest and Jungle tiles (without removing them). It gives +2 Production. It also gives +2 Gold after researching Guilds.
* Mohawk Warrior reworked. It now replaces Longswordsman (instead of Swordsman). It is unlocked by Metal Casting (instead of Steel). It has the Drill 1 promotion (instead of the old Forest/Jungle bonus).
To do - Longhouse currently uses the same icon and model as the Brazilwood Camp. A new one would be nicer, but it works fine without.

### Civ Buffs - Japan:
Japan is one of the weakest civs. All of its bonuses look better than they actually are and are very situational. This mod makes Japan a more effective domination civ.
* Trait buffed. It now also provides a +15% Combat Bonus when attacking. However, it provides only +1 Culture from Atolls (instead of +2).
* Zero replaced by Dojo, a unique Barracks. It gives +3 Culture.
* Samurai buffed. It is now unlocked by Metal Casting (instead of Steel). It upgrades into Musketman (instead of Rifleman).
To do - Dojo currently uses the same icon as the Barracks. A new one would be nicer, but it works fine without.

### Inspired Generals:
The Great Generals I and II promotions are replaced by the Inspired Generals promotion. It is functionally the same as Great Generals II, but with a clearer description. It's a small buff to units that had Great Generals I and is less confusing and annoying to look at.

### Nearby Observatories:
Observatories are the only reason to settle cities adjacent to mountains. This mod makes them available in cities within 2 tiles of a mountain that is inside your territory, like the Machu Pichu and Neuschwanstein wonders.

### Unit Path Rework:
This mod the stats and upgrade paths of various units, including some new units, for better balance and variety.
* Commando introduced as a rework of the Marine. It costs 375 Production and has 60 Strength, 3 Movement, 3 Sight, Amphibious, Embarkation with Defense, and ignores terrain costs.
* Explorer introduced as a rework of the existing unit from the Scramble for Africa scenario. It is unlocked by Rifling and upgrades to Commando. It costs 150 Production and has 20 Strength, 3 Movement, 3 Sight, and ignores terrain costs.
* Scout and Shoshone Pathfinder now upgrade to Explorer. Via ancient ruins, they still upgrade to Archer and Composite Bowman respectively.
* Pike and Shot introduced as a standard unit. It is based on the Spanish Tercio, except with 20 Strength and 135 Production Cost.
* Spanish Tercio now replaces Pike and Shot (instead of Musketman). It has 135 Production Cost (down from 160), but keeps its 26 Strength.
* Pikeman and Landsknecht now upgrade into Pike and Shot (instead of Lancer). Zulu Impi still upgrades into Rifleman.
* Knight and its unique replacements now upgrade into Lancer (instead of Cavalry).
* Lancer and its unique replacements now upgrade into Cavalry (instead of Anti-Tank Gun). They are made obsolete by Combustion. They no longer have Formation I, but have 28 Strength (up from 25) and the Heavy Charge ability (which is now lost on upgrade).
* Tank now has 80 Strength (up from 70). German Panzer now has Enhanced Flank Attack, since it already had 80 Strength.
* Bazooka is now unlocked by Rocketry (instead of Nuclear Fission). It has 80 Strength and Ranged Strength (down from 85), but has a 50% bonus vs Armor units.
* Helicopter Gunship now requires Oil (instead of Aluminum) and has 80 Strength (up from 60).
* Battleship now upgrades into Missile Cruiser.
* Missile Cruiser now has Indirect Fire.
