# Civilization V Mods

A collection of my mods for the game Sid Meier's Civilization V.

## Usage

Clone the collection

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/m-j-rahman/civilization_5_mods.git
```

Copy or move the folder for the mod you want to use to the MODS folder.

Windows: 

* Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5\MODS

Mac:

* Documents/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization V/MODS

Linux:

* ~/.local/share/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS

For example, to use the mod "Nearby Observatories" on a Linux machine, the path should end up as:

The mod should then be available to select from the in-game Mods screen.  
Restart the game if it is already running.  

## Collection

### Civ Buffs - Assyria:
Assyria is usually a weak civ on higher difficulties, due to being quickly outpaced before they can take advantage of their bonuses. This mod buffs Assyria to make it an effective domination civ.
* Royal Library now gives +15 XP without needing to fill the Great Work slot (instead of +10 XP after filling the Great Work slot).
* Siege Tower now has 14 Combat Strength (up from 12) and can attack other units. It upgrades into Musketman (instead of Trebuchet).

### Civ Buffs - Carthage:
Carthage is one of the weakest civs. All of its bonuses look better than they actually are and quickly become redundant. This mod buffs Carthage to make it an effective domination civ.
* African Forest Elephant replaced by Barca, a unique Great General. It has higher Movement, debuffs nearby enemy units, and also acts as a Great Admiral.
* Quinquereme changed to a Naval Ranged unit. It has 10 Combat Strength, 11 Ranged Strength, 2 Range, Quick Study promotion, and upgrades into Galleass (instead of Caravel).

### Civ Buffs - Iroquois:
The Iroquois are the weakest normal civ (i.e. besides Venice). Their unique ability doesn't work as intended, their unique building is worse than the normal version, and their unique unit is insignificant. This mod buffs the Iroquois to fix all of that.
* Trait completely replaced. It now provides the Woodsman promotion to all military land units, as well as +1 Food from Camps and unimproved Forests.
* Longhouse now also gives the same Production bonus as the normal Workshop (+10%) and costs 90 Production to build (down from 100, vs 120 for Workshop).
* Mohawk Warrior now replaces Longswordsman (instead of Swordsman). It is available at Metal Casting (instead of Steel).

### Civ Buffs - Japan:
Japan is one of the weakest civs. All of its bonuses look better than they actually are and are very situational. This mod buffs Japan to make it an effective domination civ.
* Trait now also provides a +10% Combat Bonus. +1 Culture from Atolls (instead of +2).
* Zero replaced by Dojo, a unique Barracks. It gives +3 Culture.
* Samurai now available at Metal Casting (instead of Steel). It upgrades into Musketman (instead of Rifleman). It has the Cover I promotion (instead of Shock I).

### Inspired Generals:
The Great Generals I and II promotions are usually weak and have unclear descriptions. This mod renames Great Generals II to Inspired Generals and gives it a more helpful description. Units with the Great Generals I promotion now have Inspired Generals instead.

### Melee Mounted Paths:
This mod changes some unit upgrade paths to make more sense.
* Warrior and its unique replacements upgrade into Spearman (instead of Swordsman). They also become obsolete at Civil Service (instead of Metal Casting).
* Pikeman and Landsknecht upgrade into Musketman (instead of Lancer). Impi still upgrades into Rifleman.
* Lancer and its unique replacements upgrade into Cavalry (instead of Anti-Tank Gun).

### Nearby Observatories:
Observatories are the only reason to settle cities adjacent to mountains. This mod makes them available in cities within 2 tiles of a mountain that is inside your territory, like the Machu Pichu and Neuschwanstein wonders.
